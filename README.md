# Description
The program simulates a hamster daycare, where I have a CSV file with Hamster names, genders, owners etc which gets uploaded to a MSSQL database upon creation.
The program works in "tick" which means that for every tick until 100, the hamsters checks in, goes to exercise for every 6 tick and goes home at 100.
